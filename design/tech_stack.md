Symfony for the application, a MySQL database + javascript for connecting API
### pro's:
- great for backend
- easier tech stack since both developers know PHP
- no costs at all
### cons:
- less easy to integrate API into application
- require a lot of setup (like installing symfony, composer, xampp, phpmyadmin and making sure we're using the same database)
